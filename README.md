# Password Generator

Simple password generator built with HTML, Tailwind CSS (CDN), and vanilla JavaScript.

Features:
- Generate random passwords with configurable length (4–64)
- Choose character sets: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols
- Copy password to clipboard with one click
- Strength indicator

Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve from a local server).
2. Adjust the length and which character types to include.
3. Click `Generate` to create a password.
4. Click `Copy` to copy it to the clipboard.

Notes
